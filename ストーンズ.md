### Sweet Verginia

```
D                      B                 A
Wading through the waste        stormy winter
D                      B                  A
and there's   not a friend  to help you through
D                      B                 A        D
Trying to stop the waves  behind your eyeballs
A                     D                        A   D
Drop your reds       drop your greens an' blues

Bm        G      Bm         G
Childhood living is easy to do

Am         C    D G                   D
The things you wanted, I bought them for you

Bm        G     Bm             G
Graceless lady, you know who I am

Am               C   D G                  D
You know I can't let you slide through my hands
```

```
Bm            G        Bm           G
I watched you suffer a dull, aching pain

Am       C   D  G              D
Now you decided to show me the same

Bm          G     Bm          G
No sweeping exits or offstage lines

Am                 C   D  G            D
Could make me feel bitter or treat you unkind
```

Chorus

I know I dreamed you a sin and a lie

Am                 C   D  G            D
I have my freedom, but I don't have much time

Bm            G        Bm           G
Faith has been broken, tears must be cried

Am    C        D      G       D
Let's do some living after we die

Angie, Angie,

When will those clouds all disappear?

Angie, Angie,

G             F             C
Where will it lead us from here?

         G                          Dm            Am
With no loving in our souls, and no money in our coats 

C         F             G
You can't say we're satisfied

    Am     E
But Angie, Angie,

G          F            C
you can't say we never tried

Angie, I still love you,

  G       F                        C
Remember all those nights we cried?

G
All the dreams we held so close

           Dm           Am   C
seemed to all go up in smoke

          F             G
Let me whisper in your ear

Angie, Angie

                F           C
Where will it lead us from here?

all your kisses still taste sweet

I hate that sadness in your eyes
