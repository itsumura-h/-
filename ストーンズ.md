### Sweet Verginia

D                      B                 A
Wading through the waste        stormy winter
D                      B                  A
and there's   not a friend  to help you through
D                      B                 A        D
Trying to stop the waves  behind your eyeballs
A                     D                        A   D
Drop your reds       drop your greens an' blues

Bm        G      Bm         G
Childhood living is easy to do

Am         C    D G                   D
The things you wanted, I bought them for you

Bm        G     Bm             G
Graceless lady, you know who I am

Am               C   D G                  D
You know I can't let you slide through my hands

Bm            G        Bm           G
I watched you suffer a dull, aching pain

Am       C   D  G              D
Now you decided to show me the same

Bm          G     Bm          G
No sweeping exits or offstage lines

Am                 C   D  G            D
Could make me feel bitter or treat you unkind
```

Chorus

I know I dreamed you a sin and a lie

Am                 C   D  G            D
I have my freedom, but I don't have much time

Bm            G        Bm           G
Faith has been broken, tears must be cried

Am    C        D      G       D
Let's do some living after we die

[Verse 1]
Well I followed her to the station
With a suitcase in my hand
Yeah, I followed her to the station
With a suitcase in my hand
Whoa, it's hard to tell, it's hard to tell
When all your love's in vain

[Verse 2]
When the train come in the station
I looked her in the eye
Well the train come in the station
And I looked her in the eye
Whoa, I felt so sad so lonesome
That I could not help but cry

[Verse 3]
When the train left the station
It had two lights on behind
Yeah, when the train left the station
It had two lights on behind
Whoa, the blue light was my baby
And the red light was my mind

[Outro]
All my love was in vain
All my love's in vain
